      <description>Are college football teams passing more on first down this season compared to past seasons? The number of college football teams have fluctauted over the past years, so it&amp;rsquo;s best to caluculate this as a percentage. We&amp;rsquo;ll need to first find how many total plays have been run on first down, then find how many of those have been passing plays. From there, we&amp;rsquo;ll divide the number of first down passing plays for each season by the total number of first down plays for each season and multiply it by 100 to get a whole number percentage.</description>
